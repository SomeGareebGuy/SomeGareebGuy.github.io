Throughout my summer vacation, I tried to get into abstract algebra, learning about Group and Ring Theory from _Dummit and Foote_. The process was long and often challenging, but over time, the pieces began to fit together.

When I returned to campus this semester, I approached my Linear Algebra professor to ask if there were any projects I could work on at my level. He cautioned me that attempting advanced mathematics without a solid foundation could do more harm than good. Still, after a bit of persuasion, he handed me a single page  
_"Note on Nuclei and Affine Blocking Sets" by Aart Blokhuis._

That was last Wednesday. For several days, I didn’t dare open it—the very first line contained the words _affine_ and _Desarguesian_, which made it seem like an insurmountable wall. But when I finally started reading on Monday, I realized that this was something I might actually be able to work through on my own.

With guidance from the professor’s TA (Satya bhaiya), I picked up _Incidence Geometry_ by G. Eric Moorhouse for a basic introduction to the field. On his advice, I also explored symmetric polynomials through Jian Zhou’s _Introductions to Symmetric Polynomials and Symmetric Functions_.
