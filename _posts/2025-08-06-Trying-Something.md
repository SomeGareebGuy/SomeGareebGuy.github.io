This is the start of "Trying something".  A blog series started by me to exhibit all the hijinks I am upto and to keep a track of my progress through the stuffs. It is easier this way for me to tell someone what I am currently trying and to showcase past projects since with time I also find it hard to be up to date on every stuff I had done in the past.

## Why call it *"Trying Something"* ?
Throughout the years I have tried to do a lot of things and failed at them pretty hardly. The number of projects I have started and not completed through is actually insane. So I wanted to call this project something like Trying Something and Seeing it through, or simply "Trying Something", so that I get more motivation to get up and track down my progress.

## So what are your goals now?
While writing this as of now, I am currently at the third/final year of my Bachelors of Sciences in Mathematics at NIT Rourkela. I enrolled into the programmed Integrated Master of Sciences in Mathematics, but after the NEP-2020, an institute is bound to handover a Bachelors degree after completion of 3 years of study. This means that I have the chance to aim for completing my Masters degree at another college. So this project will be trying to build a proper understanding of what I am currently studying in order to fully prepare for exams like NBHM, IIT-JAM, TIFR GS, etc. 

I also have done no formal internships till now, and even though I am passionate about studying and creating things involving Mathematics, I don't have much to prove that till now. Due to this another goal that this project will be aiming towards would be to show my progress through the projects that I am creating.

Add to this the fact that I am also passionate about Design and Coding, I will try my best to use them whenever I can, even though I will always make sure to not waste too much time delving into these.

## Some Basic Things
This is made using Jekyll template "[Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)", and these posts are made using Markdown files, so I could always change them, but I will keep this a personal rule to never do that, in order to have a fair look at my past self's thought process (I might fix some grammar mistakes tho). The coding ,from my side at least, in this website is also not that much and most of it is inspired from [GIles Castel](https://castel.dev/), so make sure to visit that too.

I have also created a Notion file where I listed all the things that I feel like I should be doing in a proper ordered way and would like to keep updating my progress through this timeline decided as of now. 

That's all for my introduction post, make sure to check out the others when they are out!
